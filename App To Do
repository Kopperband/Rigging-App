Things To add and tweak:\
definitions:
 radius
circumference
diameter


need to add the rest of the math calculations which include:
- inches to feet:
  foot decimal = X / 12
- complex shapes which should just be a multitude of different simple volume calculations
- coeefiecnt of friction
- Center of gravity: STARTED
- Load on each sling: STARTED
- list of sling WLL and sizes


Current math in program:
  Measurements:
    Length
    Width
    Height
    Diameter
    Thickness
    Unit Weight
  Volume / Weights:
    Hollow Cylinder Math
    Solid Rod
    Rectangle
  Calculations:
    Load Angle Multipliers

Thoughts / Ideas
-I need to come up with a better way to control the flow of the program and adjust the wording to make everything a bit more clear to the user.
-as well as looking at maybe changing some strings to symbols after gain a better understanding of how they work in order to increase program speed.
-I also want to look into if I can use ruby and SQL in conjunction for the list of equipment sizes and WLL but that will be a further down the road problem
- I should check to see if i can use this with HTML/CSS/JS in order to make a GUI for easibility and portability as well as to make this a bigger project with
more languages involved which may be a ruby on rails type thing more so on the server side.
