Things To add and tweak:\
definitions:
 radius
circumference
diameter


need to add the rest of the math calculations which include:
- inches to feet:
  foot decimal = X / 12
-volume of a hollow cylinder:
    length * (width = circ = 3.14 * diameter) * thickness * unit weight
-solid rod:
  ((3.14 * (diameter * diameter)) / 4) * length * unit weight
- complex shapes which should just be a multitude of different simple volume calculations
